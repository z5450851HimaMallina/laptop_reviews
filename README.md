# Customer Review Analysis: Unlocking Insights from Amazon Laptop Feedback

### A Text Analytics Project Using SAS Visual Text Analytics

## Project Summary
This project applies advanced text analytics to over 6,000 customer reviews from Amazon to uncover actionable insights into customer sentiment, product satisfaction, and brand performance across eight leading laptop brands. Using SAS Visual Text Analytics, I translated unstructured review data into meaningful themes that inform product development, customer experience strategy, and targeted marketing initiatives.
 
## Business Objective
•	Understand customer perceptions around product features, service, and performance.

•	Identify key drivers of satisfaction and dissatisfaction by brand and user segment.

•	Enable data-driven decisions for product improvement, warranty policy, and post-sales support.

•	Segment and quantify customer needs—especially for high-value personas like gamers or power users.
 
## Project Scope
This analysis focuses on:
•	Over 6,400 Amazon laptop reviews (800 per brand).

•	8 brands: Acer, Alienware, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, MSI, Razer.

•	Text-based customer feedback with corresponding rating and product metadata.

•	Using both predefined and custom models in SAS Visual Text Analytics for concept extraction, topic discovery, and categorization.
